# FilmSpot

Filmspot is a Rails App built to help you keep track of movies you've seen, and suggests movies for you to watch. You can sign up by either email or Facebook, then:

- Mark movies as seen
- Give a movie a rating
- Use the random movie picker API to find new movies

## Installation

Clone the repository, then execute:

`$ bundle`

## Usage

Migrate the database:

`$ rails db:migrate`

To start the server, run:

`$ rails s`

Then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

You'll need to create your own movie entries for now, until an API is implemented to pull in movie data.
